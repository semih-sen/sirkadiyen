## ADR-001: Use a .NET primary backend

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-07-21

### Context

The rewrite requires authentication, licensing, user profiles, background jobs, transactional state changes, Google API integration, incremental synchronization, and administrative workflows.

### Decision

Use .NET 10 and ASP.NET Core for the primary backend, with a separate .NET Worker Service for background operations.

### Consequences

- Strong typing and mature background-service support.
- One primary application ecosystem for business logic.
- Python remains isolated to parsing.
- Domain boundaries must prevent infrastructure leakage.

---

## ADR-002: Keep Python parser-only

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-07-21

### Context

Spreadsheet structures are irregular and Python is suitable for specialized parsing and fixture-driven experimentation.

### Decision

Python will only parse normalized source snapshots and return canonical candidate records, evidence, warnings, metrics, and confidence information.

Python will not manage users, licenses, OAuth, database publication, affected-user resolution, or Google Calendar writes.

### Consequences

- Clear ownership boundaries.
- Parser can be tested deterministically.
- .NET remains authoritative for business state.
- A versioned HTTP contract is required.

---

## ADR-003: Use Google-only authentication

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-07-21

### Context

The product is tightly integrated with Google Calendar and does not require password-based accounts.

### Decision

Registration and login will use Google authentication only.

### Consequences

- No password storage or recovery system.
- Google identity does not imply product activation.
- Local user and onboarding state remain necessary.
- Google Calendar authorization scopes must be managed separately or incrementally as appropriate.

---

## ADR-004: Require administrator-issued license activation

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-07-21

### Context

Access is controlled through codes distributed by administrators.

### Decision

A Google-authenticated user must redeem a valid license code before completing activation and synchronization.

### Consequences

- License redemption must be transactional.
- Codes must be stored as secure hashes.
- Redemption attempts require rate limiting and audit logs.
- Exact expiration, revocation, and reuse policy remains open.

---

## ADR-005: Use canonical schedule records between parsing and calendar sync

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-07-21

### Context

Source spreadsheet formats differ and change. Direct mapping from cells to Google events would tightly couple parsing with synchronization.

### Decision

All parser outputs must be converted into a canonical schedule model and published as versioned revisions before calendar synchronization.

### Consequences

- Parsing, validation, diffing, and synchronization are independently testable.
- Every event can retain provenance.
- Publication and rollback workflows are required.

---

## ADR-006: Use incremental event synchronization

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-07-21

### Context

The old system deleted and recreated a broad two-week event range.

### Decision

Routine synchronization will update only events affected by a published semantic schedule diff.

### Consequences

- Durable user-to-Google-event mapping is required.
- Stable lesson identity and content hashing are required.
- Calendar jobs must be idempotent.
- Full rebuild is reserved for explicit repair operations.

---

## ADR-007: Preserve immutable raw source snapshots

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-07-21

### Context

Parser behavior must be explainable and reproducible.

### Decision

Every changed source acquisition is stored as an immutable snapshot before parsing.

### Consequences

- Historical parser runs can be reproduced.
- Storage use increases.
- Snapshot retention policy may be added later.
- Source evidence can be shown to administrators.

---

## ADR-008: Use parser profiles instead of one universal parser

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-07-21

### Context

The source inventory contains several structurally distinct spreadsheet families.

### Decision

Implement shared parsing primitives and multiple named, versioned parser profiles.

### Consequences

- Changes to one schedule family are less likely to break others.
- Each profile requires fixtures and regression tests.
- Source configuration must map each source to a parser profile.

---

## Open decisions

The following require future ADRs:

- frontend framework and component system
- exact browser session strategy
- managed Google Calendar strategy
- license reuse, expiration, and revocation policy
- background queue implementation
- source polling interval policy
- automatic publication thresholds
- profile schema and supported group combinations
- snapshot retention policy
- whether the canonical record needs a curriculum-block field, which the annual
  sources state and the parser currently keeps only as evidence
- how recurring rows such as `HER HAFTA PAZARTESİ` become dated lessons
- whether holidays and semester breaks become all-day calendar entries

---

## ADR-009: Use a versioned normalized snapshot and parser JSON contract

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-07-21

### Context

The inspected spreadsheet families contain Excel date serials, fractional time
values, merged headings, formatting-dependent structure, multiple meaningful
worksheets, and separate lookup tables. Sending only displayed cell text would
lose evidence and make deterministic parsing unreliable.

### Decision

Use an explicit versioned JSON contract between .NET ingestion and the Python
parser.

- JSON properties use camel case and enums use camel-case strings.
- Worksheet coordinates are zero-based and range ends are exclusive.
- Snapshots preserve user-entered, effective typed, formula, formatted, note,
  merge, hidden-dimension, and relevant formatting data.
- Parser responses echo correlation and source identifiers and include canonical
  candidates, evidence, warnings, metrics, and confidence indicators.
- Transport contract versions and parser-profile versions evolve independently.

### Consequences

- C# and Pydantic models must remain contract-compatible.
- Contract serialization requires regression tests.
- Snapshot payloads are larger than value-only grids.
- Acquisition may use sparse cells but must retain structurally meaningful blank
  cells.
- Breaking wire changes require a new contract version.

## ADR-010: Model anatomy group independently from general practice group

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-07-21

### Context

First- and second-year students have an anatomy assignment that does not follow
their normal practice-group assignment. The confirmed Grade 2 autumn and spring
source lists rotate anatomy groups `1`, `2`, and `3`. The Grade 1 anatomy source
uses the same or a very similar grouping model.

### Decision

Represent anatomy group as an independent student-profile and schedule-audience
dimension with supported values `1`, `2`, and `3` for the confirmed Grade 1 and
Grade 2 model.

Grade 2 anatomy and vertical-corridor sources apply to both Turkish and English
programs. During source joining, `Diseksiyon` identifies anatomy entries in the
annual program, while `Uygulama` identifies vertical-corridor and other practice
entries that require source-specific disambiguation.

### Consequences

- General practice group must never be reused as anatomy group.
- Profile validation must request and validate anatomy group separately.
- Audience selectors need an `anatomyGroup` dimension.
- Annual and special-program sources must enrich the same logical lesson rather
  than publish duplicates.
- `Uygulama` alone is insufficient to identify vertical-corridor lessons; parser
  profile context and joined evidence are required.

## ADR-011: Shared normalization primitives never infer missing values

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-07-21

### Context

Source cells hold dates as serials or as Turkish and English text, times as day
fractions or as text with inconsistent separators, and group labels in several
shorthand forms. A parser that guesses is convenient in the short term, but a
wrong guess silently invents or misroutes lessons, and the mistake reaches
student calendars without anything to review.

### Decision

Every shared resolver returns an explicit result carrying the rule that produced
it, a confidence score, and a reason code when it did not resolve. Three
behaviours that would otherwise be guesses are opt-in per parser profile:

- reading a numeric cell as a date serial when no number format declares a date
- completing a date written without a year
- reading a bare four-digit block such as `0900` as a time

Additionally:

- a range whose end does not follow its start stays unresolved rather than being
  reordered
- a group expression that is only partly understood resolves to nothing, because
  keeping the understood half would silently drop a cohort
- a digit run longer than two characters is never a group value, so serials,
  years and room numbers cannot be mistaken for cohorts
- a weekday found beside a date is cross-checked and reported, never used to
  correct the date

### Consequences

- Parser profiles must declare their column rules explicitly.
- Unresolved values become warnings, so revision validation sees them.
- More source rows will initially fail to parse than with a permissive parser.
  That is the intended trade: an unparsed row is visible, a wrong row is not.
- Confidence scores are fixed constants per rule so output stays deterministic.

## ADR-012: Golden files are the parser regression net

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-07-21

### Context

Determinism is a contract requirement, but shared primitives are used by every
profile, so a small change to normalization can silently alter many candidates.

### Decision

Fixture output is compared against committed golden files. Regeneration is
explicit through the `SIRKADIYEN_UPDATE_GOLDEN` environment variable and the
resulting diff must be reviewed and explained. Each golden document records the
fixture, the subject, and the parser engine version.

Determinism is asserted directly by running each producer twice and requiring
identical serialized output.

Until the first fixture-backed profile exists, the golden subject is a
normalization trace over synthetic fixtures. Synthetic fixtures are labelled as
such and never presented as captured faculty data.

### Consequences

- A changed golden file is a reviewable statement that parser output changed.
- Real fixtures require normalized snapshot JSON, which the .NET ingestion layer
  does not yet produce. This blocks fixture-backed profiles.
- The same harness will compare full parse responses once profiles exist.

## ADR-013: Inbound wire models accept camel case only

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-07-21

### Context

ADR-009 fixed camel case as the JSON convention. Pydantic models that only
accept aliases cannot be constructed from Python by field name, which the parser
needs for the response models it builds itself.

### Decision

Split the Pydantic contract bases. `ContractModel` accepts camel-case aliases
only and is used for the snapshot models and the parse request. The parser
builds outbound models, so `OutboundContractModel` additionally accepts field
names while still serializing camel case.

### Consequences

- A snake-case inbound payload remains a validation failure, not a tolerance.
- The wire format is unchanged in both directions.
- Tests construct snapshot models through the same camel-case validation path a
  real producer would use.

## ADR-014: Normalize Google Sheets responses before hashing

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-07-21

### Context

Parser profiles require normalized snapshot JSON, but the production acquisition
path did not exist. Google Sheets responses can return sparse and offset grid
segments, repeated cells from overlapping ranges, typed and formatted values,
merge metadata, and hidden dimensions. Hashing the raw response would couple
change detection to API response order and incidental acquisition metadata.

### Decision

The .NET infrastructure layer uses the official Google Sheets v4 client and maps
responses into the v1 normalized snapshot contract before calculating a hash.

- The application port receives snapshot identity and acquisition time from its
  caller; infrastructure does not invent them.
- Worksheets, merges, cells, dimensions, and requested ranges are put in a
  deterministic order.
- Identical repeated cells are deduplicated. Conflicting repeated cells are
  omitted and produce an error diagnostic, so API response order cannot choose
  an arbitrary value and the conflict is never silently accepted.
- Theme colors remain explicit as `theme:{name}` when no resolved RGB value is
  available.
- The lowercase `sha256:` hash covers contract version, normalized worksheets,
  and acquisition diagnostics, but excludes source ID, snapshot ID, and
  acquisition time.
- Authentication is supplied at composition time and must use the read-only
  spreadsheets scope; credentials never enter snapshot mapping.

### Consequences

- Reacquiring identical content produces the same content hash even when API
  collections or acquisition metadata differ.
- Structural, range-scope, cell-content, formatting, and diagnostic changes are
  detectable by the future polling workflow.
- Real snapshot capture still requires source configuration, authenticated
  worker composition, and immutable persistence.
- The local `.xlsx` fixtures remain unable to drive profiles until live snapshots
  are captured or a clearly separated development converter is added.

## ADR-015: Separate source transport from document format

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-07-21

### Context

The confirmed inventory contains seven Google Sheets sources, Google Drive XLSX
and DOCX files, and a direct HTTP XLSX download. A parser profile should not need
to know how its evidence was transported.

### Decision

Maintain a versioned source catalog that separately records transport, document
format, parser profile, and fixture mapping. Transport adapters acquire bytes or
grid data; format converters produce the normalized snapshot contract. The
local XLSX converter is fixture-only, emits an explicit diagnostic, and trims
formatting-only worksheet tails using a semantic used range.

### Consequences

- New transports and formats can evolve independently.
- Parser profiles consume one stable snapshot contract.
- Drive/HTTP adapters and DOCX conversion remain implementation work.
- Real XLSX fixtures can unblock parser-profile development without presenting
  local conversion as a production acquisition path.

## ADR-016: Require an unattended source credential

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-07-21

### Context

Worker polling has no interactive browser session. A Google OAuth client ID and
client secret identify the application but do not authorize unattended access.

### Decision

Configure exactly one source-access mode: OAuth with an offline refresh token,
or a service-account credential file. Request only the read-only spreadsheets
scope. Never commit or log credential material, and keep source ingestion
credentials separate from end-user Calendar grants.

### Consequences

- The current environment still needs a source refresh token or service account.
- A service account is preferred when the faculty can share sources with it.
- Revocation and invalid-grant failures must become explicit poll outcomes.

---

## ADR-017: Parse requests carry an explicit source context

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-07-22

### Context

A canonical candidate must state its academic year, class year, program language
and interpretation timezone. No workbook states any of them. The Grade 1 Turkish
and Grade 1 English annual workbooks are also served by the same parser profile,
so the profile name cannot carry the language either. The alternatives were to
infer the academic year from the observed date range, infer the language from
the profile name, and infer the class year from a cell, all of which are guesses
that ADR-011 rules out.

### Decision

`ParseSnapshotRequest` carries a required `sourceContext` holding
`academicYear`, `classYear`, `programLanguage` and `timeZoneId`. The values come
from source configuration owned by .NET. The parser uses them directly and never
derives them.

Where a workbook does state something the context also states, the profile
validates rather than infers: a row whose term cell names a different class year
is excluded and counted, and a term cell that states nothing usable is reported
as an anomaly.

### Consequences

- The wire contract changed; the C# record, the Pydantic model and the shared
  contract fixture were updated together and both suites assert on it.
- The source catalog must eventually carry academic year and language per
  source; today they are supplied by the caller.
- One profile can serve several sources without branching on source ID, which
  ADR-008 requires.

## ADR-018: Stable identity includes the lesson start time

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-07-22

### Context

The annual sources repeat one title several times on one day: free study, a
practice block and a break all recur. Identity built from academic year, class
year, language, date and course identity alone therefore collides, and the
colliding rows are genuinely different lessons. Adding an occurrence index would
make identity depend on row order, which ADR-005 and the identity pattern forbid.

### Decision

The annual stable identity is the ordered hash of academic year, class year,
program language, local date, local start time, and normalized course identity.
Instructor, location, curriculum block, end time and title formatting are
content, not identity, and live in the content hash instead.

A lesson moved to another time therefore changes identity. The semantic diff
engine's deterministic secondary matching, not the identity, is responsible for
recognizing a moved lesson so it is patched rather than deleted and recreated.

### Consequences

- Room, instructor and title reformatting update the existing calendar event.
- Time changes reach the diff engine as an unmatched pair, so Phase 8 must
  implement secondary matching before incremental sync goes live, otherwise a
  rescheduled lesson would be deleted and recreated.
- Course identity ignores a leading list number (`1.`, `1)`, `1-`) because the
  source renumbers those lists whenever the schedule shifts.

## ADR-019: Golden files project large parse responses

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-07-22

### Context

ADR-012 made golden files the parser regression net and anticipated comparing
whole parse responses once profiles existed. A real annual workbook produces
around 900 candidates and a 1.5 MB response. Committing every field of every
candidate produces a diff nobody reads, which would defeat the purpose.

### Decision

A parse golden file records:

- one digest line per candidate: candidate ID, date, start and end time, event
  type, truncated identity and content hashes, and a truncated display title
- the complete warnings, metrics and confidence indicators
- the first and last candidate in full, pinning the field shape
- a SHA-256 digest of the entire serialized response

### Consequences

- A moved, retimed, reclassified or reworded lesson is visible in the diff.
- A change to a field no digest line covers still fails, through the response
  digest, and is then investigated locally.
- Golden files stay around 140 KB per fixture instead of several megabytes.
- ADR-012 is amended, not superseded: regeneration remains explicit and every
  changed golden must be explained.
