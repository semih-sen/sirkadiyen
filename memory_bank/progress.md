## Current next action

The Google Sheets path is now joined end to end: the worker seeds and lists
polling-enabled sources, acquires and stores immutable snapshots, calls the
parser through a strict HTTP client, and creates the parse run, candidate
revision, and canonical records. Failed parser transport calls resume the same
logical run, and adaptive Istanbul-time polling implements ADR-026.

The next safety boundary is revision validation. Implement record validation
and the ADR-025 review rules before publication: deletion greater than 20
percent, unknown group selectors, and multiple impossible overlaps must move a
revision to `ReviewRequired`. Then add transactional publication and only after
that begin the semantic diff.

The completed Google Sheets path is:

```text
list polling-enabled sources
→ acquire a snapshot per source
→ store through the short circuit
→ begin or resume the parse run
→ call the parser over HTTP
→ transactionally create a revision and canonical records
```

In parallel, obtain either an offline source refresh token or a service-account
credential with access to the Sheets sources. Drive/HTTP acquisition adapters,
DOCX conversion, recovery of stale `Running` parse runs, and the remaining
parser profiles are still required.
